# hanja-tagger #

Automatic Korean Hanja tagging tool powered by Hanjaro (hanjaro.juntong.or.kr)

## Getting Started ##

Install this package by running the standard `setup.py` install command, after cloning this repo.

   python setup.py install

## Tagging Korean with Hanja ##

First, initialize a `Hanjaro` object, which will manage relevants sessions and cookie.
You should be able to obtain raw tagging results from [Hanjaro](http://hanjaro.juntong.or.kr).

```python
>>> from hanjatagger import Hanjaro
>>> with Hanjaro() as hjr:
       print(hjr.query("안녕하세요"))
"안녕(安寧)하세요"
```

This package comes with a more programming-friendly wrapper for the query results. Use `HanjaroTagger` to obtain more stream-lined tag results from the query.

```python
>>> from hanjatagger import Hanjaro, HanjaroTagger
>>> with Hanjaro() as hjr:
        tagger = HanjaroTagger(hjr)
        print(tagger.tag("안녕하세요"))
"安寧   "
```

The return string is as long as the input query (`len(ret) == len(q)`), and all hanja characters will be replaced by chinese characters, while other non-hanja characters replaced by spaces.

Several options can be configured for HanjaroTagger during initization:

  * `simplified_han`: converts Traditional Chinese characters (zh-cn) into Simplified Chinese characters (hans-cn).
  * `unified_cjk`: converts Chinese characters possibly encoded in [CJK compatibility unicodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_compatibility_characters) into CJK Unified Ideographs.
